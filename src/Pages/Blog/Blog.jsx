            Differences between uncontrolled and controlled components
          </h1>
          <p className="font-normal">
            Controlled components use React state to manage and update their
            values, while uncontrolled components rely on the browser's default
            behavior and the DOM API. Controlled components offer more control
            and flexibility, while uncontrolled components are simpler to set
            up.

            How to validate React props using PropTypes?
          </h1>
          <p className="font-normal">
            PropTypes is a tool in React that helps ensure that the correct
            types of props are being passed into components. To use PropTypes,
            we define a propType for each prop in our component using the
            prop-types library. This helps prevent errors and make our code more
            reliable.

            Difference between nodejs and express js?
          </h1>
          <p className="font-normal">
            Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code on
            the server. Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that
            provides features and tools for building web applications.
            Express.js makes it easier to create server-side applications with
            Node.js.

            What is custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
          </h1>
          <p className="font-normal">
            A custom hook is a JavaScript function that allows you to reuse
            logic across your React components. You might create a custom hook
            to simplify my code, remove duplication, or make my components more
            modular and reusable.
